# TODO

## Development

Remove `app/notes` pages. Replace them with a stubbed page for prompting the user

Display raw results on page
Massage data on the client side and put it into a cohesive UI
Image generation API
Display the image on the frontend
Polish layout

## Documentation

Update README
Add more docs for brainstorming ideas
